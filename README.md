# Multi Todo

## Multiple Todo Lists

I was looking for a service that had a barebones todo list that I could use for my daily use. I couldn't find one that fit exactly what I needed. I didn't want any of the unnecessary bells and whistles. So I set forth and created one that I could use. Hopefully it is of some use to anyone going through this.
