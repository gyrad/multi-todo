# Multi Todo

With **Multi Todo** you can have multiple todo lists which can be updated and deleted at will. The state is stored locally on the browser and persists even when the page is refreshed, using `Window.localStorage` from the browser's _Web Storage API_.

I was looking for a service that had a barebones todo list that I could use for my daily use. I needed something where I could have multiple todo lists. I couldn't find one that fit exactly what I needed. I didn't want any of the unnecessary bells and whistles. So I set forth and created one that I could use. Hopefully it is of some use to anyone going through this.
